2. Docker Containerization: docker-compose.yml

3. ECS Deployment Strategy
Task Definitions:
Define your container specs (image, CPU/memory, environment variables, IAM role, logging) in a JSON or via the AWS Console.

Networking:
Use AWS VPC with public/private subnets. Assign security groups to allow HTTP traffic. Use an Application Load Balancer for service discovery and routing.

IAM Roles:
Attach an IAM role to the ECS task with least-privilege permissions for CloudWatch Logs, Secrets Manager, and Parameter Store.

Service Discovery:
Use ECS Service with a Load Balancer or AWS Cloud Map for DNS-based service discovery.

4. Observability & Secure Configuration
CloudWatch Logs:
Configure ECS task definition to send container logs to CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.

AWS Secrets Manager:
Store sensitive data (DB credentials, API keys) in Secrets Manager. Retrieve them in your app using the AWS SDK at runtime.

Systems Manager Parameter Store:
Store non-sensitive configuration (feature flags, connection strings). Access via AWS SDK or environment variables.

5. CI/CD Implementation
AWS CodePipeline:

Source: GitHub repo
Build: AWS CodeBuild (build, test, Docker image push to ECR)
Deploy: ECS (update service with new image)
GitHub Actions:

Workflow triggers on push/PR.
Steps: Build, test, Docker build, push to ECR, update ECS service via AWS CLI.
Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet: deploy.yml

Summary:
You now have a .NET 6 Web API with a /run-risk-job endpoint, containerized for ECS, with a deployment strategy covering task definitions, networking, IAM, and service discovery. Observability and secure config use CloudWatch Logs, Secrets Manager, and Parameter Store. CI/CD can be implemented with CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.
