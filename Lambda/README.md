1. BorrowerRatingJob.cs file 

2. Triggering via EventBridge or API Gateway
EventBridge:
Create an EventBridge rule (e.g., scheduled every hour or on specific events).
Set the Lambda function as the target.
Example:
Rule: rate-borrowers-job
Schedule: cron(0 * * * ? *) (every hour)
Target: Lambda ARN

API Gateway:
Create a REST API or HTTP API.
Define a resource and method (e.g., POST /trigger-rating).
Integrate the method with the Lambda function.
Secure with IAM, API keys, or Cognito.

3. Oracle RDS Interaction & Security
Interaction:
Use an ORM (e.g., Dapper, Entity Framework) or Oracle Data Provider for .NET.
Connect using RDS endpoint, credentials, and query/update borrower data.

Securing Access:

IAM Policies:
Attach an IAM role to Lambda with least privilege (e.g., only allow access to secrets, logging).

VPC Configuration:
Place Lambda in the same VPC/subnet as Oracle RDS.
Configure security groups to allow Lambda to connect to RDS on the required port (default: 1521).
Use AWS Secrets Manager for DB credentials.

4. Monitoring & Alerting (CloudWatch)
Metrics:
Lambda automatically publishes metrics: Invocations, Duration, Errors, Throttles.
Custom metrics can be logged via PutMetricData.
Alarms:

Create CloudWatch Alarms for:
Error count > 0
Duration exceeds threshold
Throttles > 0
Configure SNS notifications for alarms to alert operations team.

Summary:
Lambda function processes borrower data and logs execution.
Triggered via EventBridge (scheduled/event-driven) or API Gateway (on-demand).
Connects securely to Oracle RDS using VPC, IAM, and Secrets Manager.
Monitored via CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms for reliability and performance.
